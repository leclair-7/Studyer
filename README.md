Studyer Readme

##Since I'm in school, this is an app to help me study "more effectively" which is another way of saying "less"
==============================================================================================================

To Do List:
*POS tag the sentence and see if any of answer's noun is in lemmalist
*PEG 100 list implement an all numerical metrics flashcard learning
*session by session pickling remembering, cpickle for speed, maybe do a db
*feed it a notes file then it gives learning, diaplaying pictues on django site,
*unit tests for every function, code coverage
*learn Django and put an SSH to Alderon login
*find a thesaurus for hints, like dict = {word : [synonyms] }
*learning mode and test mode and an easy switch between them

Since this project is for a good time with a focus on good, the documentation
at times has an air of irony or a lack of seriousness, etc.

For now this is a semi working app with set of working code parts to be combined once I learn how to use Django;
I may decide not to use it.

###Features To Do:
[all of them!!]

###TESTING
unit test modules

###UI
this will be on a Django driven webpage

###QUESTION ANSWER HEURISTICS
Want the neural network (seems like the best way to find optimal weights of an array of tests) to see the size of the vector and construct itself accordingly, or
maybe do a binary search style parameter finding with a sklearn SVM..

then presumably...
it'll feel pretty accurate to me the user

###QUIZ
getting close enough to the right answer function
put question answer time in performance,
when the user doesn't get a close answer, have a hint

    ideas for criteria for answer being right:
    quantify by weighing the criteria: sync with one's confidence of mastery of material
    this is how markdown displays code!!!! :) :) :)


##f it  *A A

###REMEMBERING YOUR PAST
*use past quiz sessions for customized future sessions

*Memory 100 peg list helper, make it make crazy associations based on nouns not being on top 10000 english used
but also being syntactically close to current noun and the one associated with the number

*ambiguity is an issue though
