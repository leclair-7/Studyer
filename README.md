###Studyer Readme

##Since I'm in school, this is an app to help me study "more effectively" which is another way of saying "less".
==============================================================================================================

To Do List:
* test optimal time frequency between asking questions, change probability of Q being asked accordingly
* timestamp each time a question is answered
* change probability its asked based on elapsed time
* pressure for test mode
* unit tests for every function, code coverage
* displaying pictures on django site,

Since this project is for a good time with a focus on good, the documentation
at times has an air of irony, a lack of seriousness, etc.

###Features To Do:
[all of them!!]

###TESTING
unit test modules

###UI
this will be on a Django driven webpage

###QUESTION ANSWER HEURISTICS
find a way to train a model with user data only, maybe that and a combo of aggregate will be better

then presumably...
it'll feel pretty accurate to me the user

###QUIZ
getting close enough to the right answer function
put question answer time in performance,
when the user doesn't get a close answer, have a hint

    ideas for criteria for answer being right:
    quantify by weighing the criteria: sync with one's confidence of mastery of material
    this is how markdown displays code!!!! :) :) :)

###REMEMBERING YOUR PAST
* use past quiz sessions for customized future sessions

* Memory 100 peg list helper, make it make crazy associations based on nouns not being on top 10000 english used
but also being syntactically close to current noun and the one associated with the number

* for hints language ambiguity is an issue
